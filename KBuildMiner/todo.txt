We need a major refactoring:
Make each list (the assignment of sth. to a list respectively) a node in the AST and adapt the traversal. Should make everything a bit more robust and enables the implementation of more heuristics, such as:

busybox/archival/libunarchive:
...
ifneq ($(lib-y),)

	lib-y += $(COMMON_FILES)

endif
...
